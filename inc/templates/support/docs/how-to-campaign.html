The images below explain the fields available to you while setting up a basic campaing using Smart RTB's self-serve platform.
<br/><br/>
When creating a new campaign the <i><b>Campaign Name</b></i> field will be used to distinguish between the multiple 
campaigns you may be running.</br>  
The image below shows where you will enter your campaign name.  One of the most imperative fields when creatign a new campaign will be your <i>Total Budget</i>.</br>

The <i><b>Total Budget</b></i> field allows you to allocate a limited amount of your funds for this particlular campaign.</br>
Keep in mind that your total budget could possibly be consumed in a single day if you set the <i>Daily Budget</i> to the
 same as your Total Budget.</br>

The <b><i>Daily Budget</i></b> field allows you to set a limit to your funds per day.  
<br/>This field can prove useful during the first several days of your campaign when you are testing the initial response 
to your campaign. </br>  
Keep in mind the value you plan on setting your <i>Default Bid (CPM)</i> to when limiting your Daily Budget.<br/>

Your <b><i>Default Bid</i></b> is only for traffic that does not match a specific Smart Bid rule.  Your <i>Default Bid (CPM)</i> does not apply to all baseline traffic.</br>  
The <i>Default Bid</i> only applies to traffic that meets your basic criteria under the <i>Settings</i> tab, but does not have a specific rule applied.  <br/>
This field is declared as CPM (Cost per thousand impressions). <br/>

The <b><i>Frequency Cap</i></b> limits the number of times your ad is shown to the same user per day (optional field).</br>  
Setting a <i>Frequency Cap</i> is noted as a way to avoid banner burnout, the point where visitors are being overexposed and response drops.</br>
A frequency cap of 5-8 is suggested.  At campaign completion this is an attribute that can be reported upon in order to revise for your next campaign.</br>

<b><i>Per Placement Spend Limit</i></b> is how you set a daily spend limit for each ad spot.  This field prevents one publisher from eating all of your daily 
funds by accident. (optional)</br>

A <b><i>New Destination Link</i></b> is the web page users will be sent to when clicking an ad.  </br>
Multiple links may be added to rotate and split-test your best pages.
