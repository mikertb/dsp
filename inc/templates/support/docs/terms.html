    <span>RTB</span>
    RTB stands for Real-Time-Bidding, a process in which a group of advertisers, including yourself,
    will 'bid' for every possible ad impression through an auction. This occurs every time someone
    visits a web page or an app screen - billions of times a day.

    <span>Impression</span>
    This is a term to describe a single ad view, or showing.<br />
    If someone visits a web page and sees your ad once, this is a single impression.
    The CPM model works on an average price per 1000 views.
