Smart RTB is a Real-Time-Bidding ad network. Each ad impression is auctioned off and bid on by multiple advertisers
in real-time, and the advertiser with the highest bid CPM wins and their ad is shown.

This means that instead of paying a fixed price CPC or CPM, you pay the absolute least required to display your ads.
Therefore saving money and paying a real valuation of the ad space.
