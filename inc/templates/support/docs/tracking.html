You may track conversions (actions) for your campaign reports. To do this, you must setup a post back link
to notify our servers an action has happened.
<br /><br />
<code>http://dsp.smrtb.com/bid/converted/<IMPID></code>
<br /><br />
Replace <IMPID> in your postback with the impression id from your tracking token.
<br />
Your actual token for this in the postback url will be different depending on what platform you use. If you use
HasOffers for example, the token would br
{aff_sub}, so your link would look like
<br />
<code>http://dsp.smrtb.com/bid/converted/{aff_sub}</code>
